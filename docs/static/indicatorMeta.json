The balance of the weight within Ecosystem Vitality lies with Pollution Emissions (5%), Agriculture (5%), and Water Resources (5%).

The 2020 EPI introduces a new indicator, controlled solid waste, within a new issue category, Waste Management. While we are hopeful that this indicator proves useful for shaping policy and inspiring greater attention in this issue category, we recognize that its novel nature also holds some degree of uncertainty in the underlying data and in the assumptions and decisions we made in its construction (see Chapter 7 for further discussion). We therefore assigned the issue category a modest weight of 5% of the policy objective. As our confidence in the metrics supporting Waste Management grows, we expect its weight may increase. The balance of indicators come from IHME and are measured in Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates (see Chapters 4–6). Aggregated to a global level, we find that the majority of DALYs lost are due to air pollution and, within that suite of risks, to ambient particulate matter (PM2. 5), which receive the greatest weights among the issue categories and indicators, respectively. All non-waste weights roughly correspond to the proportion of DALYs lost worldwide in the most recent year of available data (Blanc et al., 2008).

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people. Average percentage of population affected is calculated by dividing the sum of total affected for the period stated by the sum of the annual population figures for the period stated.","Units":"% of population, average 1990-2009","Category":"Environment","Subcategory":"Land use","Dimension":"none","Dataset":"wdi","Source":"EM-DAT: The OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database: www.emdat.be, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels (Belgium), World Bank.","Link":"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.CLC.MDAT.ZS","Priority":"1.0","# Years":168,"# Countries":1,"Note":null,"Dataset Code":null,"Notes":null,"Year":null,"Unnamed: 0":null},"EN.CO2.BLDG.ZS-gt":{"Indicator Code":"EN.CO2.BLDG.ZS-gt","Indicator":"CO2 emissions from residential buildings and commercial and public services","Definition":"CO2 emissions from residential buildings and commercial and public services contains all emissions from fuel combustion in households.
