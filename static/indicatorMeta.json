While we are hopeful that this indicator proves useful for shaping policy and inspiring greater attention in this issue category, we recognize that its novel nature also holds some degree of uncertainty in the underlying data and in the assumptions and decisions we made in its construction (see Chapter 7 for further discussion). We therefore assigned the issue category a modest weight of 5% of the policy objective. As our confidence in the metrics supporting Waste Management grows, we expect its weight may increase.
