                <a href="http://unohrlls.org/about-sids/" target="_blank">Small Island Developing States (SIDS)</a> are a distinct group of 38 UN Member States and 20 Non-UN Members/Associate Members of United Nations regional commissions that face unique social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities. The three geographical regions in which SIDS are located are: the Caribbean, the Pacific, and the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS).
              </p>
              <p>
                SIDS were recognized as a special case both for their environment and development at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
              </p>
              <p>
                The aggregate population of all the SIDS is 65 million, slightly less than 1% of the world’s population, yet this group faces unique social, economic, and environmental challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                SIDS face a host of challenges including, for many, their remote geography. As a result, many SIDS face high import and export costs for goods as well as irregular international traffic volumes. Yet, they must rely on external markets for many goods due to the narrow resource base.

                The current phase has been focused on the aggregation and visualization of publicly available development-related datasets in SIDS to support policymaking and to provide an opportunity for international, regional, and sub-regional SIDS-SIDS collaboration. In our next phase, we intend to use these collated datasets to build analysis tools that identify trends and generate insights specifically focused on the developmental challenges and solutions relevant for SIDS.
